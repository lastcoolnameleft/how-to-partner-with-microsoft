# Agenda

# Background

I'm a [Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lastcoolnameleft/) who focuses on Partners, specifically [Cloud Native Compute Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) software companies.

The first time Azure Marketplace journey can be confusing, so I've created this to provide clarity.

---
# Audience

Tech companies that want to make money with Azure!

I often work with smaller startups, but this could be applicable to any company interested in co-selling with Microsoft.

P.S.  If you have a booth a [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/), we should talk.

# Intent

By end of this session you will understand the Microsoft Partner ecosystem and know how and where to get started.
